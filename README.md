# 📊 SQL Analysis: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT/DSAT)

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project showcases advanced SQL techniques to process and analyze customer support data. I focused on identifying service friction points and comparing agent performance using raw datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* **Language:** SQL (MySQL 8.0)
* **Key Skills:** * **Data Cleaning:** String standardization and handling `NULL` values with `COALESCE`.
    * **Analytics:** Implementation of **Window Functions** (`PARTITION BY`) to calculate team averages without collapsing data.
    * **Business Logic:** Calculating DSAT % metrics to drive operational decisions.

## 📈 Business Impact
By applying these queries, I can isolate agents whose performance deviates from the team mean, enabling data-driven coaching and improving overall customer sentiment.
