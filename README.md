# 📊 SQL Project: Customer Sentiment & Service Analytics

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL proficiency by transforming raw customer support logs into actionable business insights. I focused on identifying service friction points and evaluating leadership performance through data-driven metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Advanced Skills
* **SQL Engine:** MySQL 8.0
* **Data Cleaning:** Implemented `COALESCE` for null-handling and string standardization (`TRIM`, `UPPER`).
* **Advanced Analytics:** Utilized **Window Functions** (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`) to benchmark individual agent performance against team-specific averages.
* **Relational Data Modeling:** Created and connected multiple tables using `INNER JOINs` to link operational tickets with organizational leadership structure.

## 📈 Key Insights & Queries
1. **Agent Benchmarking:** Isolated agents whose resolution times significantly deviate from their team's mean for targeted coaching.
2. **Managerial Performance:** Aggregated DSAT (Dissatisfaction) metrics by Manager and Department to pinpoint operational bottlenecks.
3. **Data Integrity:** Cleaned and categorized non-responsive surveys to ensure KPIs reflect real customer sentiment.
